# Law of Fairness — Research Materials

This repository contains formal materials related to the Law of Fairness hypothesis.

## Statement of the Hypothesis

The Law of Fairness proposes a strong-form conservation principle applied to conscious experience. It asserts that within a single unified conscious stream, the lifetime integral of net felt experience (positive minus negative affect integrated across time) converges to neutrality at irreversible termination (“Death of Mind”).

Formally, if F(t) represents moment-to-moment net affect, the lifetime ledger is:

L(T) = ∫₀ᵀ F(t) dt

The hypothesis asserts that at irreversible termination:

L(T) → 0

## Scope

- The claim applies only to individual unified conscious lives.
- It does not assert equality of external outcomes.
- It does not claim distributive or social fairness.
- It is evaluated only at closure (Death of Mind).

## Falsifiability

The hypothesis is falsified if a unified conscious life can be shown to terminate with a clear residual imbalance of net felt experience outside defined neutrality bounds.
